#### Rules:
 * Each round, you and the CPU both roll a pair of dice.
 * Your score for the round will be based on the sum of the dice.
 * If you roll doubles (e.g. a 3 and a 3) then your score is multiplied by 2.
 * Rolling a 1 will give you a score of 0 for that round.
 * The player who has the most points at the end of three rounds is the winner.
